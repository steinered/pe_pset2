In this problem set, we continue analyzing the FTP program, but we reinterpret treatment
status. In FTP, as in other programs, there was confusion among respondents about whether
they were subject to a time limit. For the purposes of this problem set, we will consider
respondents who said that they were subject to a time limited as treated, and those who said
they were not as controls. Our goal will be to estimate the effect of a perceived time limit on
welfare receipt, employment, and the like. The idea is that you cannot be influenced by a time
limit if you don’t believe it applies to you, whether or not it applies to you in fact.
All data and documentation can be found on Canvas under Problem Set 1.

(1) The question about the time limit comes from the four-year survey, the results of which are
contained in the file ftp_srv.dta. Start by merging this file to ftp_ar.dta. How many of the
original sample members were interviewed for the survey?

```{r import data}
ftp_ar <- read_dta("ftp_ar.dta")
```

(2) Tabulate the variable fmi2. How many of the survey respondents have valid (i.e., non-
missing) responses? How many thought they were subject to a time limit? How many thought
otherwise? How many were unsure? Finally, what explains why the number of valid responses
is less than the number of people interviewed for the survey? (Hint: examine variables fmi1 and
fmi1a.)
(3) Define a new treatment dummy that is equal to one for people who believed they were
subject to a time limit and equal to zero for those who did not or were not sure. Call it TLyes.
Cross-tabulate TLyes and the experimental dummy (“e”). Discuss confusion about the time
limit.
(4) Using TLyes as your treatment indicator, estimate by OLS the effect of the time limit on theh
number of months of welfare receipt during years 1-2 post_RA. To do this, estimate a
regression of your dependent variable on TLyes and the set of control variables used by MDRC
in their publications (the ones with the string “cova:” in their labels). Do you believe these
regressions consistently estimate the effect of the time limit? Explain.
(5) Provide conditions under which the experimental dummy would be a valid instrument for
the time limit.
(6) Estimate the first-stage regression of TLyes on e. Do you have a weak-instrument problem?
(7) Use the experimental dummy as an instrument to estimate the effect of the time limit on
the number of months of welfare receipt during years 1-2 post-RA. How do the welfare receipt
results compare to the OLS estimates from question (4)? Can you summarize the direction of
bias associated with the OLS estimates?
(8) Explain why you would expect the exclusion condition to fail for the above regression.
(9) Now estimate a model with age-group interactions, along the lines of what you did in PS 1.
Define the same four age groups, and estimate the same model, but interact the age-group
dummies with TLyes rather than e. Estimate the model by OLS. Omit the control variables.
(10) Now estimate the same model, but use interactions between e and the age-group
dummies as instruments for the interactions between TLyes and the age-group dummies.
Comment on how estimating the model with age-group interactions helps to satisfy the
exclusion restriction.
(11) Discuss your estimated effects of time limits and how they compare with the estimates
from question (9). Can you diagnose why the two sets of coefficients differ?
